# Protected-Files Directory

## Purpose

This directory contains **backup copies** of specific files from the `content/` folder that the module author wants to protect from user modification or accidental deletion.

## Important Notes

- **AI clients never see this folder** - It's invisible to users and AI assistants
- **For author-protected files only** - Used to preserve files the author wants to keep unchanged
- **Protected backup storage** - Contains specific files the author doesn't want users to modify
- **Not user-editable** - Users work entirely in the `content/` workspace

## Contents

This folder may contain backup copies of:
- Essential AI instruction files
- Important template files
- Critical reference materials
- Core project structure files

## Restoration Process

If a user accidentally deletes important files from their `content/` workspace, administrators can restore them from the backups stored here.

## Maintenance

- Keep this folder synchronized with essential files from `content/`
- Update backup copies when core files are modified
- Remove backup files that are no longer needed

---

**Note**: Users work exclusively in the `content/` directory. This `protected-files/` directory contains author-protected file backups only.
