# Decision Patterns

## Decision-Making Style
- **Analytical**: Prefer data and structured analysis for important decisions
- **Collaborative**: Seek input from key stakeholders before major decisions
- **Quick**: Fast decisions on low-impact items to preserve energy
- **Reflective**: Sleep on major decisions when time allows

## Optimal Decision Times
- **Morning (9-10 AM)**: Best cognitive state for complex decisions
- **Avoid afternoon**: Decision fatigue peaks after 3 PM
- **Next day**: For major decisions, always review with fresh perspective

## Decision Framework
1. **Define the decision**: What exactly needs to be decided?
2. **Gather key information**: 80% confidence level is sufficient
3. **Consider 2-3 options**: Avoid analysis paralysis
4. **Set decision deadline**: Prevent endless deliberation
5. **Implement quickly**: Good decision + fast action > perfect decision + delay

## Decision Categories
- **Reversible**: Make quickly, adjust if needed
- **Irreversible**: Take time, gather input, consider long-term impact
- **Low impact**: Delegate or decide in under 5 minutes
- **High impact**: Use structured decision process

## Effectiveness Tips
- Batch similar decisions together
- Create decision templates for recurring choices
- Track decision outcomes to improve future judgment
- Set implementation deadlines to prevent decision limbo
