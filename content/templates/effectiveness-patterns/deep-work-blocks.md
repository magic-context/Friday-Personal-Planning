# Deep Work Blocks

## Optimal Deep Work Schedule
- **Primary Block**: 9:00-11:00 AM daily (2 hours minimum)
- **Secondary Block**: 7:00-9:00 PM (evening creative time)
- **Emergency Block**: 6:00-8:00 AM (when primary is compromised)

## Deep Work Environment
- **Location**: Quiet space, minimal distractions
- **Tools**: Single monitor, noise-canceling headphones, water nearby
- **Phone**: Airplane mode or in separate room
- **Notifications**: All disabled during deep work blocks

## Deep Work Activities
- **High Priority**: Complex problem-solving, strategic thinking, writing
- **Medium Priority**: Learning new skills, detailed analysis, planning
- **Avoid**: Email, administrative tasks, routine work

## Protection Strategies
- Block calendar time as "Focus Time - Do Not Schedule"
- Set expectations with team about response times during deep work
- Batch similar deep work tasks together
- Use 25-minute Pomodoro technique for sustained focus

## Effectiveness Tracking
- Track completed deep work hours weekly
- Note which types of work are most productive during different blocks
- Adjust schedule based on energy and output patterns
