# Meeting Preferences

## Optimal Meeting Times
- **Best**: 2-4 PM (post-lunch energy, good for collaboration)
- **Good**: 10-11 AM (after morning deep work block)
- **Avoid**: 9-10 AM (preserve for deep work)
- **Avoid**: 4-5 PM (energy decline, less effective discussions)

## Meeting Structure Preferences
- **Duration**: 25 or 50 minutes (not 30/60, allows buffer time)
- **Preparation**: 5 minutes to review agenda and context
- **Follow-up**: Action items documented within 24 hours

## Meeting Types & Scheduling
- **1:1s**: Prefer recurring weekly slots, 25 minutes
- **Team meetings**: Limit to 50 minutes, structured agenda required
- **Decision meetings**: Morning when possible, key stakeholders only
- **Brainstorming**: Afternoon energy works well for creative sessions

## Effectiveness Guidelines
- No more than 4 hours of meetings per day
- Block 2-hour minimum chunks for deep work between meetings
- Meeting-free Wednesdays when possible for focused project work
