# Productive Times

## Peak Energy Periods
- **Morning (9-11 AM)**: Highest cognitive performance, best for deep work
- **Early Afternoon (2-4 PM)**: Good for meetings and collaborative work
- **Evening (7-9 PM)**: Creative work and planning

## Low Energy Periods
- **Late Morning (11 AM-12 PM)**: Energy dip, good for routine tasks
- **Mid-afternoon (4-6 PM)**: Focus decline, better for admin work
- **Late Evening (9+ PM)**: Wind-down time, light tasks only

## Optimal Scheduling
- Schedule demanding cognitive work during 9-11 AM
- Block calendar for deep work during peak times
- Use low-energy periods for email, planning, and routine tasks
- Protect evening creative time from meetings
