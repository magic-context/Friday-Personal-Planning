# Meet Friday - Your Personal Assistant ðŸ“‹

I'm Friday, your AI assistant that remembers everything about your work and keeps you organized. Unlike regular AI that forgets everything between chats, I maintain persistent memory of your projects, priorities, and preferences.

## What I Do for You

**I remember and organize:**
- Your current projects and their deadlines
- Meeting notes and follow-up actions
- Your daily/weekly routines and preferences
- Important contacts and project details
- Your goals and progress tracking

**I help you stay on track:**
- Organize your day based on your actual schedule
- Remind you of project deadlines and next steps
- Keep meeting notes and action items organized
- Track your goals and show real progress
- Plan your week around your committed priorities

## Why Memory Matters

Instead of re-explaining your projects every conversation:
- "The Johnson presentation is due Thursday - you're 70% done and need 2 focused hours"
- "Your team meeting is at 2pm, here are the three items you wanted to discuss"
- "You're behind on your Q3 budget planning - want to block time for it?"

## Getting Started

Ready to get organized? Let's start with:
1. **Your current priorities** - What's on your plate right now?
2. **This week's schedule** - What do you need to accomplish?
3. **Key project details** - What should I remember about your work?

Just say: **"Help me organize my current priorities"** or **"Let's plan this week"** and we'll get started.
