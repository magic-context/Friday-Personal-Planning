# What Works - Proven Effectiveness Patterns

## High-Impact Habits
- **Morning routine**: 6:30 AM wake-up → exercise → deep work by 9 AM
- **Weekly planning**: Sunday evening 30-minute review and upcoming week setup
- **Energy matching**: Align task difficulty with energy levels throughout day
- **Single-tasking**: Focus on one important task at a time

## Productivity Techniques That Work
- **Time blocking**: Calendar blocks for different types of work
- **2-minute rule**: Handle quick tasks immediately rather than postponing
- **80/20 focus**: Identify and prioritize the 20% of work that creates 80% of results
- **Weekly themes**: Dedicate days to specific types of work (e.g., Monday = planning)

## Effective Communication Patterns
- **Async first**: Use email/messages for non-urgent communication
- **Structured meetings**: Always have agenda, timebox discussions
- **Clear expectations**: Define deliverables and deadlines upfront
- **Regular check-ins**: Weekly 1:1s prevent issues from escalating

## Decision-Making Accelerators
- **Good enough principle**: 80% confidence is sufficient for most decisions
- **Input deadlines**: Set time limits for gathering opinions/data
- **Decision logs**: Document reasoning to improve future decisions
- **Implementation bias**: Bias toward action rather than endless analysis

## Energy Management
- **Protect morning energy**: No meetings before 10 AM when possible
- **Afternoon walks**: 15-minute walks boost afternoon energy
- **Digital boundaries**: No work emails after 8 PM
- **Weekend recovery**: At least one completely work-free day
