# Effectiveness Experiments

## Currently Testing

### Experiment: Morning Routine Optimization
**Hypothesis**: Starting with 10 minutes of planning increases daily productivity
**Duration**: 4 weeks (started 2025-07-15)
**Method**: Track daily output and satisfaction scores
**Early Results**: TBD
**Next Review**: 2025-08-15

### Experiment: Time-blocked Email
**Hypothesis**: Checking email only at 9 AM, 1 PM, 5 PM reduces distraction
**Duration**: 2 weeks (started 2025-07-22)
**Method**: Track focus session quality and email response time
**Early Results**: TBD
**Next Review**: 2025-08-05

## Completed Experiments

### ✅ Pomodoro Technique (Completed 2025-07-01)
**Result**: EFFECTIVE for certain types of work
**Learning**: Works well for writing/analysis, less effective for creative work
**Implementation**: Use for admin tasks and detailed analysis

### ❌ Standing Desk (Completed 2025-06-15)
**Result**: NOT EFFECTIVE for this user
**Learning**: Caused fatigue and distraction, reduced focus quality
**Decision**: Returned to sitting desk with ergonomic setup

### ✅ Weekly Reviews (Completed 2025-06-01)
**Result**: HIGHLY EFFECTIVE
**Learning**: 30 minutes Sunday evening planning prevents Monday morning chaos
**Implementation**: Now permanent part of weekly routine

## Experiment Ideas to Try

### Energy Tracking
- Track energy levels hourly for 2 weeks to identify optimal work periods
- Test correlation between sleep, exercise, and cognitive performance

### Meeting-Free Mornings
- Block 9-11 AM daily for 4 weeks, measure deep work output
- Compare productivity on meeting-heavy vs. meeting-light days

### Digital Minimalism
- Remove social media apps from phone for 2 weeks
- Track impact on focus quality and mental clarity

### Batch Processing
- Group similar tasks (emails, calls, admin) into specific time blocks
- Measure efficiency vs. handling tasks as they arise

## Experiment Framework
1. **Clear hypothesis**: What specific improvement do you expect?
2. **Measurable outcome**: How will you know if it worked?
3. **Time-bound**: Set start and end dates
4. **Track consistently**: Daily or weekly measurement
5. **Objective review**: Evaluate results honestly at end

## Notes
Only run 1-2 experiments simultaneously to isolate variables and avoid overwhelming change.
