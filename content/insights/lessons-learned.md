# Lessons Learned - Effectiveness Insights

## Planning Lessons
- **Over-planning backfires**: Detailed hour-by-hour schedules create stress when disrupted
- **Buffer time essential**: Always add 25% more time than estimated for tasks
- **Context switching costly**: Batch similar tasks together to maintain focus
- **Weekly > daily planning**: Daily plans should flow from weekly priorities

## Time Management Insights
- **Morning energy is finite**: Protect first 2 hours for most important work
- **Afternoon energy dips predictable**: Plan routine/admin tasks for 2-4 PM slump
- **Meeting recovery time**: Need 10-15 minutes between back-to-back meetings
- **Travel days write-off**: Don't plan productive work on heavy travel days

## Decision-Making Lessons
- **Analysis paralysis real**: Set decision deadlines to force choice
- **Perfect information myth**: Rarely have all data needed; decide with 70-80% confidence
- **Delegation delays**: Spending time to delegate early saves time later
- **Sunk cost awareness**: Don't continue ineffective approaches due to past investment

## Communication Patterns
- **Overcommunication better**: Assume others need more context than you think
- **Written > verbal**: Important decisions should be documented in writing
- **Response time expectations**: Set clear expectations about email/message response times
- **Meeting fatigue real**: Back-to-back meetings reduce effectiveness significantly

## Energy & Focus Insights
- **Multitasking illusion**: Task switching reduces quality and increases time
- **Notification damage**: Even brief interruptions require 5-10 minutes to refocus
- **Physical environment matters**: Cluttered space = cluttered thinking
- **Social energy separate**: Introverted tasks require different energy than people-facing work

## Effectiveness Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- **Busy = productive fallacy**: Activity doesn't equal achievement
- **Always-on mentality**: Constant availability reduces deep work capacity
- **Perfectionism paralysis**: Good enough + action > perfect + delay
- **Comparison trap**: Others' productivity systems may not work for you
