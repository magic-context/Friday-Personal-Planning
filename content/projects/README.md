# Projects

This folder organizes project-specific information and references for easy tracking and retrieval.

## Organization Structure

Create a **separate folder for each project** using a clear, descriptive name:

```
projects/
├── johnson-presentation/
├── q3-budget-planning/
├── team-onboarding-process/
├── platform-development/
└── personal-effectiveness-system/
```

## Project Folder Contents

Each project folder can contain:
- **project-overview.md** - Project description, objectives, and key details
- **timeline.md** - Important dates, milestones, and deadlines
- **notes.md** - Meeting notes, decisions, and progress updates
- **resources.md** - Links, contacts, and reference materials
- **next-actions.md** - Current tasks and immediate next steps

## Naming Conventions

Use clear, consistent folder names:
- **Use lowercase with hyphens**: `johnson-presentation` not `Johnson Presentation`
- **Be descriptive**: `q3-budget-planning` not `budget`
- **Include key identifiers**: `client-abc-renewal` not `renewal`

## Integration with Other Folders

Projects connect with other workspace areas:
- **current-status/priorities.md** - Reference active projects
- **planning/** - Time-block project work in daily/weekly plans
- **goals/annual-goals.md** - Link projects to larger objectives
- **insights/** - Capture project learnings and what works

## Example Project Structure

```
projects/johnson-presentation/
├── project-overview.md      # Project scope, stakeholders, success criteria
├── timeline.md             # Key dates: research due, draft due, final presentation
├── notes.md                # Meeting notes, feedback, decisions
└── next-actions.md         # Current tasks and blockers
```

## AI Assistant Benefits

This structure allows Friday to:
- **Track project status** across all active initiatives
- **Reference project details** when planning time or answering questions
- **Connect projects** to daily priorities and weekly planning
- **Remember project context** between conversations
- **Suggest next actions** based on project timelines and current status

## Getting Started

To create a new project:
1. **Create folder**: `projects/your-project-name/`
2. **Add project-overview.md**: Basic project description and objectives
3. **Reference in priorities**: Add to `current-status/priorities.md` if active
4. **Time-block work**: Schedule project tasks in `planning/` folders

This keeps all project information organized and easily accessible for both you and your AI assistant.
